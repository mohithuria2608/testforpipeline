Hands-on Microservices with TypeScript 3 

## Sample prerequisites:
* NodeJS 9.10 or higher 
* Typescript (npm i typescript -g)
* Mocha (npm i mocha -g)
* Docker (can use docker for windows/mac)
* Docker-compose 

## Sample code Usage:
* clone the whole repository to disk.

for non-docker examples (sections 1-3):
* go into each service directory that has a package.json file in it, and install dependencies (npm install) there can be up to 4 such service directories in a single video code, but most have only one.
* run gulp in songs & playlist directories
* use run.sh to run the example, or run similar commands on mac cmdline.

for dockerized examples (sections 4-5) build container images 
* use build.bat or run the same commands on mac
* use run.bat to run the example, or run similar commands on mac cmdline.
